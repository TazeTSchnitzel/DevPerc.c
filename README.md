DevPerc.c
=========

DevPerc.c is a (currently unfinished) interpreter for the Deviating Percolator (DevPerc) language, written in pure `-Wall -pedantic` C99.

I previously wrote [an interpreter in Python](https://github.com/TazeTSchnitzel/DevPerc).

Building
========

If you have a C compiler at `cc`, then just `make` or `make devperc` will do the trick.

Try it out like so:

    ./devperc examples/helloworld
